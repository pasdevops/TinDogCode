Where in an HTML document isthe correct place to refer to an internal style sheet ?
    <head>
        SECTION
    </head> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"></link>

CSS = CLASS SELECTORS

The difference between Class and ID selector.

An ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML. 
IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it.

A class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.
        
        

e.g. hmtl
    < img class="bacon">

e.g. css
        
.bacon{
    background 
} 
    
e.g. hmtl
    < img class="brocoli" >

e.g. css
.brocoli{
    background 
} 


CSS = ID'S SELECTORS. 

e.g. hmtl
    < img class="brocoli" >

e.g. css
#brocoli{
    background 
} 

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

The syntax of pseudo - classes:

a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
